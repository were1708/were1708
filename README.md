Hi there! I'm a computer science graduate from the University of California, Santa Cruz 🎓. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems
and I enjoy learning new programming languages and frameworks 💻🔍. I have experience in a variety of programming languages such as C++, JavaScript, and Python 💻. 
I've worked on projects such as:

- A React app to assist content creators create captions for their videos!
- A Webpage to display the water footprints of certain popular foods
- An implementation of the Huffman Encoding Algorithm in C


I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer 🚀, so feel free to reach out if you have any projects or ideas that you think I might be interested in 🤝. Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile!
